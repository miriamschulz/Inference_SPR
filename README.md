# Self-Paced-Reading study


## 1. General information

This directory contains the materials and results for a self-paced-reading study on inference generation.

Experimental design: 2 x 2 context manipulation.

8 lists (4 Latin lists in pseudorandomized order; 2 versions of each list, with button order / trial order reversed in the second version of each).

SPR experiment on PCIbex:

- Data collection link: https://farm.pcibex.net/p/jjOKBX/


## 2. Files and folders in this directory

- `ibex_files` folder: contains the PCIbex experiment files
- `results` folder: contains the cleaned and anonymized results (`results_reads.csv`) and the R-scripts to process the results:
  - `preprocess.{Rmd|html}`:
    - Reads in the raw file from PCIbex.
    - Annotates subject and list numbers / button order, trial number, etc.
    - Removes the subject excluded for timing out + extremely long RTs
    - Merges the results with the stimuli/pretests file and exports this as `results_reads.csv`.
    - Also exports demographics and experimental survey answers by participants as `results_survey.csv`.
  - `inspect.{Rmd|html}`:
    - performs data completeness checks
    - inspects the demographics and survey data
    - provides a first, *purely numeric/visual* inspection of the results (plausiblity ratings & reading times)
  - `pretests.{Rmd|html}`:
    generates the pretest plots and runs pair-wise t-tests
  - `ratings.{Rmd|html}`:
    - contains the results of the plausibility ratings: task accuracy and reaction times
  - `regression_analysis.{Rmd|html}`:
    - Reads in the preprocessed results file, inspects reading times and performs a regression-based RT analysis.

## 3. Summary of the SPR participants & recruitment criteria

- 42 subjects were recruited through Prolific (10 per Latin list; two were excluded: one due to a technical problem on PCIbex and one due to a double submission (timed out)).
- Prolific criteria:
    - Location: Germany / Austria
    - Desktop devices only
    - age 18-32
    - Nationality: German
    - First language: German
    - No language related disorders
    - No literacy difficulties
    - No participation in any of the pretest studies  
    - Approval rate: 99-100
- Experiment length and reward
    - Estimated study length: 30 minutes
    - Reward set to 8 pounds/hour
    - Actual median study completion time: 21:03 minutes
    - Actual average reward per hour: Â£11.40
- Demographics and survey results (41 subjects):
    - Age: mean 25.54, range: 19-32
    - Gender: 21 female, 20 male, 0 other
    - Handedness: 37 righthanded, 3 lefthanded, 1 ambidexter
    - Native language: 39x German only, 1x German and Turkish, 1x German and Czech
    - Problems and remarks reported: none
    - Guesses, strategy, remarks: see exported file `Survey_textanswers.csv`. 4 participants noted that negation was a factor in the design; 1 of these noted that trials with "nie" were mostly implausible.
    - Should their data be kept, i.e. did they take part seriously? 41x yes
